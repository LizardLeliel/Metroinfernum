Maybe demons are all over the place, with extremely varying believes, most of them hostile agaisnt humans but a few also having goodwill to humans. However, since demons differ from each other so much, there's a lot of fighting in between demons as well

HUMANS:

DEMONS:
They scavange similiar to humans. They have to avoid humans similiarly; they can take them on, but they are far more tenacious then they can comprehend. They scour the world for different things - learning human technology to become even better, tools to breakthrough to the undergroundd, or just hunting humans to strengthen themselves. Or trade with the more kleptomatic demons.

Eating human flesh does make demons more powerful, after all.
