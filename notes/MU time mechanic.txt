- Turn based

Actions cost a bulk of turns

For example, entering a new room takes ten turns
In the ten turns it takes you to move to that new room, another thing can happen.
The slower you are, the more turns it takes - 12 if lightly slowed, 25 for max slowed.
Attacking also takes turns. (slow)
Picking up an item takes less turns. (slow)
Sorting inventory takes turns. (slow)
Unequiping/equiping takes turns. (slow)
Laying traps due too.
Screaming.
How often poison hurts.
